Just finished:
    - Chat now creates its own key, loads key, gets sharable string key, enc/decrypt messages from string.
    - When inviting users, it sends sym key BUT NOT ENCRYPTED with their pub key (cuz it doesn't exist yet)

Need to do:
    - Be able to create a IKey from bytes.
    - Use base64 to create sharable public key
        - Put key in create user message
        - Create update public key call for restoring account...
        - Delete storage/keys if new user is logged in!!!

   - Add ability to process chat I was added to and sym key *******

   - Maybe have keys (in secureStorage) have value that includes user's username so another account cant get it...
        - But would they even be trying to access it if the chat isn't on their list of chats?

   - Check if new chat name already exists...

   - Maybe not save users, what if they update their pub key?
