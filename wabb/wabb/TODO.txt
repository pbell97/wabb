Just finished:
    - Chat now creates its own key, loads key, gets sharable string key, enc/decrypt messages from string.
    - When inviting users, it sends sym key BUT NOT ENCRYPTED with their pub key (cuz it doesn't exist yet)

Need to do:
    - Encrypt a message before sending it
    - Decrypte a message when receiving it OR decrypt when displaying it (Prob better option since it will stay encrypted in storage.

    - Be able to create a IKey from bytes.
    - Use base64 to create sharable public key
        - Put key in create user message
        - Create update public key call for restoring account...
        - Delete storage/keys if new user is logged in!!!
